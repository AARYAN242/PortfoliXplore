                  The title of the webpage is set as "MY PORTFOLIO."
                  External CSS file ("style.css") is linked for styling.
                  The navigation bar contains links to different sections of the webpage, including Home, Skills, Projects, About Me, and Contact Me
                  The "home" section includes a banner image with the title "AARYAN RAJ" and a subtitle indicating affiliation with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, RV University.
